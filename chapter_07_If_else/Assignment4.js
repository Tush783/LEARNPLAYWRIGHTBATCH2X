/*Question 4 — Build Health Reporter
Problem: Given the percentage of test cases passed in a CI build, report build health.
100% → Green Build
90–99% → Stable (investigate failures)
70–89% → Unstable
Below 70% → Broken Build (block deployment) */

let buildHealth = 83;

if(buildHealth === 100){
    console.log("Green Build");
}
else if(buildHealth >=90 && buildHealth <= 99){
    console.log("Stable (investigate failures)");
}
else if(buildHealth >=70 && buildHealth <= 89){
    console.log("Unstable");
}
else{
    console.log("Broken Build (block deployment)");
}
